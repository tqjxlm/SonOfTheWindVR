# Son of the Wind VR

A unity VR demo that explores the possibility of wind interaction in VR experiences.

## TODO

The status of this project is quite obsolete (with unity 2017.3.0f3).

I'm currently upgrading it to the newest SDKs and hardware.

If you happen to own a hardware, feel free to try running it on existing platforms.
